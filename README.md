The above poster is a sample of the facilitators' poster I designed. it was all done in Adobe photoshop, Implementing clipping masks and filters like;
Gaussian blur filter.

I also made use of advanced blending options to add inner and drop shadows to some of the layers in my PSD file.
I have included the PSD file. it is free to download and use.

WRRIC design and marketing workflow.
